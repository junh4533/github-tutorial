The two lists below defines the differences between the two.\r\n\r\n####Git:  \r\n* Offline(local)  \r\n* Doesn't require Github  \r\n\r\n####Github:    \r\n* Requires Git  \r\n* Online(cloud-based) for collaboration  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Part 1: Initial Setup\r\n\r\n_This step will establish the connection between Github and your coding platform (eg: Cloud 9, Nitrous, etc..)_\r\n\r\n    Step 1:\r\n\r\nBefore establishing any connections, the first step is to make an account.  \r\nRegister for Github and your coding platform (if necessary).  \r\nMake sure you select the free pricing plan.\r\n\r\nNow the connection is established. But it is not secure yet.   \r\nIn order to make it secure, you'll have to setup a SSH (secure shell) key, which serves as a password for the connection \r\nbetween Github and your coding platform.\r\n\r\n    Step 2:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the settings in your coding platform. There should be a tab about SSH keys.  \r\n2. Navigate to that tab and copy the SSH key.  \r\n3. In Github, go to settings and navigate into the SSH keys tab.  \r\n4. Proceed to adding a SSH key. Be sure to give it a relevant title (the name of your coding platform is recommended).  \r\n5. Go back to your coding platform, into your IDE. Type in `ssh -T git@github.com`. Then type yes.Git vs. GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Step 3:\r\n\r\nNow you'll have to login and configure your account.\r\nUse both of the following code to log you into Github in your coding platform:\r\n\r\n`git config --global user.name (name)`  \r\n`git config --global user.email (email)`\r\n\r\n**The global means that this will apply for all repositories and the \"--\" remembers that you have logged in and so this is a one time setup.**\r\n\r\n_Congrats!! You have officially established a connection between your coding platform and Github._   \r\n_However, before you start coding, you still have to setup your repository._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Part 2: Repository Setup\r\n\r\n_This step will initialize your repo and tells the computer where to save your files._\r\n\r\n###Key Terms:\r\n**Directory - A folder that stores files**  \r\n**Initialize - To prepare a directory for a certain language (in this case, Github language)**  \r\n**Repository (repo for short) - An initialized repo, ready for coding**\r\n**Save - Storing a file locally**  \r\n**Add - Command to add a file to the stage**  \r\n**Stage - A place where a file is ready to be committed**  \r\n**Commit - Command to save a file locally on Git.**\r\n\r\n    Step 4:\r\n\r\nTo being coding, first you'll have to create a directory. Then initialize the directory so that it is a repo.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you're in the home folder.  \r\nIf you're in the home folder, you shouldn't be able to see any files when you type in `ls` into the IDE.\r\n2. Make a directory using `mkdir (folder name)`.\r\n3. Initialize the directory using `git init`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**_In case you initialized the wrong directory, you should follow these steps before proceeding further._**\r\n\r\nNow that you've initialized the wrong directory, you would want to undo it.\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to the repo where you initialized.\r\n2. In the gear icon on the filer tree, there should be an option to show hidden files.\r\n3. Enable that option and you should be able to see a folder called _.git_\r\n4. In your IDE, type in `rm -rf .git`.\r\n\r\n**\"RM\" stands for remove and the dash following it is a flag.**  \r\nWith the flag, you are triggering extra options other than simply just removing a file or directory.  \r\n**In this case, the flags \"r\" and \"f\" represents recursive and force.**  \r\nDeleteing recrusively will delete the folder _.git_ and remove any files within that folder.  \r\nWithout deleteing recursively, the folder would still be there because there are files within that fodler.  \r\nDeleteing forcefully means to delete a system file that normally cannot be removed.  \r\nAfter following these steps, you're repo is no longer initialized.  \r\nThe next time you initialize a directory, make sure you're in the directory that you want to initialize.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##Part 3: Understanding Workflow & Commands\r\n\r\n_In order to upload your code to Github, you'll have to go through the process of saving, adding to stage, committing, and pushing._\r\n\r\n###Key Terms:  \r\n**Push - Command to send files from your local machine to the Github repo**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following steps will guide you into understanding the workflow of Github:\r\n\r\n***Once in a while, you might want to use `git status` to see if the files are added to the stage.** \r\n**You can also use it to see if your files have been committed.**\r\n\r\nLet's test out your first repo!  \r\n\r\n    Step 5:\r\n\r\n1. Make a file in your repo using `touch (file name)`.\r\nMake sure you're in the folder where you want to create the file.  \r\nIf you make in the wrong folder, you can always use `rm (file name)` to delete the file.\r\n2. Save locally (you can find this option in the File Tab in the toolbar)  \r\n3. Add the file to the \"stage\" by typing `git add (file name)`. You can also add all files changed by typing `git add --all`.  \r\n4. Commit the file by typing git commit -m \"(message)\".  \r\n**The \"-m\" represents message** and within the quotation marks that follows it,  \r\nyou can leave a message for yourself so you can go back and see what you've done in that save.  \r\n\r\nYou've finished making the repo on your coding platform.  \r\nNow you would want to push the files to Github.  \r\nThe cloud server where you store your files is known as the remote.  \r\nIn order to save the files online, you'll have to push it to the repo in the remote.  \r\nIn most cases, the file will be pushed the remote nicknamed \"origin\".  \r\nInside of origin, there are many branches. To keep things simple, you'll want to push it to the \"master\" branch in \"origin\".  \r\n\r\nFirst let's setup the remote and then push it to cloud.\r\n\r\n    Step 6:\r\n\r\n1. Go to Github and click on the + symbol on the toolbar.\r\n2. Select new repo.\r\n3. Name the repo **EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE IN YOUR CODING PLATFORM**.\r\n4. Create the repo.\r\n5. Make sure SSH is selected.\r\n6. On the section where it says \"...or push an existing repository from the command line\",  \r\ncopy the first line of code and paste it into the IDE.  \r\nThe code should look something like this: `git remote add origin git@github.com:(username)/(repo name).git`  \r\n7. Type `git push -u origin master `.  \r\n\r\nDoes it look familiar? Well, you already know what push, origin, and master means.  \r\nThe **\"-u\" literally means upstream**, which tells your computer to push it to the same place (origin master) everytime you push.  \r\nNext time you want to push code, you only have to type `git push` instead of typing the entire thing.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
